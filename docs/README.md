# DigiMult

#### [Overview](#overview) | [Design](#design)

### Overview

The DigiMult features 2 DAC outputs, a trigger input, and an analog input as well as 4 potentiometers and a switch. The module can be programmed using the Arduino IDE. 

### Design

This module leverages work done by CCTV on their Cascadence module. My design is compatible with their software, but includes an analog input and uses all through hole parts.

### Buy

I'll be updating this part soon with a link to buy PCBs on Reverb. For the time being you can email me to purchase development PCBs at a discount. These will be fully functional but have minor issues.
